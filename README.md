# Movie-Ticket-Booking-System

This is project is implemented in C language and uses data structures like doubly circular linked list and trees.

The project for admin use only.
The main objective of this project is to provide necessary facilities to the admin which includes 
1. adding and deleting movie shows,
2. displaying the available movie shows,
3. displaying the seats of the theatre and
4. booking the seats for the customer.
   
As and when a new show is added by the admin, 100 vacant seats of that particular show are created.

While booking the seat of a particular movie for the customer, program will ask admin to enter the name of the movie and show number(1st show, 2nd show etc).

If the show is available, it will display the seats else it will display the appropriate message. 

Then as per the seats available and customerâ€™s demand, admin can book the seat for the asked movie show.
